Israels military said on Thursday that it was fighting in neighborhoods near the heart of the city of Rafah in southern Gaza apparently expanding its campaign against Hamas in a week when Israel has faced mounting diplomatic and legal pressure over its war effort The fighting came as the International Court of Justice in The Hague the top court of the United Nations said it would respond on Friday to a South African petition for the court to order an immediate halt to the ground assault in Rafah The court has no means of enforcing its orders but a call for Israel to rein in its offensive would be the latest setback to the country on the international stage The Israeli military said Thursday that it was operating in the Brazil and Shaboura areas of Rafah which are roughly halfway between Israels southwestern border and the Mediterranean coast When Israels push into Rafah began on May 6 the military said it was carrying out a limited operation against Hamas battalions in the city which lies along Gazas border with Egypt
